### Tasks

- auto-generate "latest" on home page

__Resolved:__



--- old ---

- make next by date link [ > ] not clickable, if last
    ==> DONE

- remove pub for images (db)
    ==> DONE, still in db, evtl. I want this back

- add seconds to images datetime_norm
    ==> DONE

- make subdirs for images/galleries and import from there
  (create galleries from subdirs)
    ==> DONE

- cleanup db functions
    ==> DONE

- cleanup json/ page meta data !!
  streamline template variables (e.g. .db... !!
    ==> DONE

- simplify tags
    ==> DONE (for now)

- gallery publish doesn't work, probably err. in template
    ==> pub/unpub _must_ be two forms/routes or else cannot work
    --> doesn't work still/again!!
    ==> FIXED restriction in db query was missing (home view)

- include image publish state
    ==> OBSOLETE removed galleries, images not in db

- image edit, evtl. save all at once
    ==> OBSOLETE removed galleries, images not in db

- rework exif for pages
    ==> DONE

- adapt gallery list (interface), too cluttered
    ==> DONE

- remove image galleries (don't like it...)
  why ?
  it's unclear when to actually use a gallery and when to write
  an article, since I sometimes/often do have images in the articles...
    --> remove it from website, the feature can be kept
    --> no, "dead features" are bad, remove it totally
    ==> DONE
    --> instead possibility to add autogenerated image markdown for a
        specific directory !!
    ==> DONE
        downside is that there is no "single image view", which is kinda nice,
        but if you really want that just link the image
    --> maybe something could be done about that ?
        --> [ref1]

- overview --> new entry --> preview
  type custom (others?) changes to article
    ==> FIXED

- image preview leads to error for images from web (http://...)
    ==> FIXED

- make gallery_id writable again,
  so manual gallery creation and automatic (by directory) is possible
    ==> OBSOLETE
