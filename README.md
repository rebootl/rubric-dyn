This is basically the underlaying system I use to manage my little personal website.

The website is live at: <http://cem.revamp-it.ch>  
(Static version due to server limitations.)

It's basically a self written "micro-cms" based on python-flask (the micro-framework) and I named it __rubric-dyn__.

Please feel free to exlore this and use for reference. But please don't use this to simply create a copy of my website.

Note that currently this is not licensed and as such should be considered copyright protected.  
Though I may release it under GPL...

Thanks :)
